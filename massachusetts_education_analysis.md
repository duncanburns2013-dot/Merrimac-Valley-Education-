# Massachusetts K-12 Education Crisis: A Comprehensive State Analysis

## Executive Summary

Massachusetts, once the undisputed national leader in K-12 education, is experiencing a systemic breakdown. Despite spending over $21,000 per pupil—among the highest in the nation—the state has failed to recover from pandemic learning loss and is watching its competitive edge erode. This analysis examines the data behind the crisis and the growing parent exodus from traditional public schools.

## The Enrollment Shift: Families Voting with Their Feet

### Statewide Enrollment Trends (2019-2025)

| School Type | Change | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Overall K-12** | -3.5% | General decline |
| **Traditional Public Schools** | -6.4% | Significant exodus |
| **Private Schools** | -1.0% | Slight decline |
| **Vocational-Technical** | +18% | Major growth |
| **Charter Schools** | +11% | Substantial growth |
| **Homeschooling** | +56% | Explosive growth |

*Source: Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education*

### What This Means

Parents are actively choosing alternatives to traditional public schools at unprecedented rates:

- **Vocational schools** are seen as providing tangible career pathways and hands-on learning
- **Charter schools** offer flexibility and specialized approaches (though capped by state law)
- **Homeschooling** more than doubled during COVID and remains 56% above pre-pandemic levels
- **Traditional public schools** are losing market share across all demographics

As the Boston Globe noted, there's "more experimentation than in the past" as families seek options that work for their children.

## MCAS 2025 Results: The Numbers Don't Lie

### Statewide Achievement Summary

| Subject | % Meeting/Exceeding (2025) | Change from 2019 | Status |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------|--------|
| ELA (Grades 3-8) | 42% | -10 points | **Declining** |
| Math (Grades 3-8) | 41% | -8 points | **Stagnant** |
| ELA (Grade 10) | 51% | -10 points | **Declining** |
| Math (Grade 10) | 45% | -14 points | **Declining** |
| Science (Grade 10) | 46% | -3 points* | **Declining** |

*Note: 10th graders in 2025 were the first class to take MCAS after voters eliminated it as a graduation requirement. DESE found evidence of reduced effort (blank answers, off-topic essays).*

### The Proficiency Crisis

**Only 42% of Massachusetts students are meeting basic expectations in English and Math.**

| Metric | ELA | Math |
|--------|-----|------|
| Districts with <50% meeting expectations | 230 (65.3%) | 227 (64.5%) |
| Districts with <25% meeting expectations | 41 (11.6%) | 65 (18.5%) |
| Districts with ≥75% meeting expectations | 6 (1.7%) | 7 (2.0%) |

**Key Finding:** Nearly two-thirds of Massachusetts districts have a majority of students failing to meet state standards.

### Top and Bottom Performing Districts (ELA)

## Per-Pupil Spending: More Money, Worse Results

### Expenditure Data (2023)

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Total Per-Pupil Expenditure** | $21,885.22 |
| **In-District Per-Pupil** | $21,255.54 |
| **State & Local Funds** | $19,799.19 (93%) |
| **Federal Funds** | $1,456.35 (7%) |
| **Year-over-Year Increase** | +7.9% |

### The Spending-Performance Disconnect

- Massachusetts increased per-pupil spending by **7.9%** from 2022 to 2023
- Total education expenditure: **$20.7 billion** for ~948,000 students
- **Net School Spending exceeds required amount by $3.4 billion** (27% above mandate)
- Yet MCAS scores continue to decline

The state is spending more money than ever while getting worse results.

## What the Experts Are Saying

> "The distinction we've earned over the last several decades of leading the nation is a characteristic that's becoming unraveled. Other states are recovering from the pandemic, and we don't seem to be at all."
> — **Edward Lambert**, Executive Director, Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education

> "Districts like Lynn, Lawrence, Revere, Everett, Fall River and Framingham have seen substantial declines from where they were scoring in 2019. That has not happened everywhere around the country—for instance, in Birmingham, Alabama, which is a fairly low-income district, is close to or back to 2019 levels of achievement."
> — **Tom Kane**, Harvard Center for Education Policy Research

> "The 2025 MCAS results are grim—but not surprising. The warning signs have been clear for some time now... we are sliding back to the 1990s, when a diploma didn't guarantee the mastery of basic skills."
> — **EdTrust Massachusetts**

> "These results are sobering... there is not one single statewide student group that has bounced back to its pre-pandemic level of achievement."
> — **Pedro Martinez**, Education Commissioner

## Policy Implications

### The Case for School Choice

The enrollment data tells a clear story: **families are choosing alternatives when given the option.**

1. **Vocational schools (+18%)** demonstrate that career-focused education has strong demand
2. **Charter schools (+11%)** show families want innovation and accountability
3. **Homeschooling (+56%)** reflects deep dissatisfaction with traditional options

Yet Massachusetts:
- **Caps charter school enrollment** by state law
- **Does not have Education Savings Accounts** like neighboring New Hampshire
- **Does not allow public funds to follow students** to private alternatives
- **Just eliminated MCAS as a graduation requirement**, removing accountability

### The Accountability Gap

- 97% of teachers rated "Proficient" or "Exemplary"
- Yet only 42% of students meet standards
- No teacher has been rated "Unsatisfactory" in many districts
- Evaluation system appears disconnected from student outcomes

### The Spending Paradox

- Massachusetts spends $21,885 per pupil
- Net school spending exceeds requirements by 27%
- The Student Opportunity Act injected billions more
- Yet achievement continues to decline
- **Money alone is clearly not the solution**

---

## Conclusion

Massachusetts is at an inflection point. The state that pioneered public education reform in 1993 and led the nation for decades is now:

- **Failing to recover from pandemic learning loss** while other states bounce back
- **Watching families flee traditional public schools** for any available alternative
- **Spending record amounts** with declining results
- **Widening achievement gaps** between affluent suburbs and Gateway Cities
- **Losing its competitive edge** as a national education leader

The data is unambiguous: the system is not working for the majority of students. When 65% of districts have fewer than half their students meeting basic standards, and families are choosing homeschooling, charters, and vocational schools at record rates, the market is sending a clear signal.

The question for policymakers is whether they will listen.
