### Important Notes

1. **COVID-19 Impact:** The 2020 school year had no MCAS testing. The 2021 scores show dramatic pandemic-related decline. However, 2022-2025 data shows minimal recovery in these three districts.

2. **State Average Comparison:** Massachusetts state averages are themselves down from pre-pandemic levels. These three districts are falling further behind an already-declining state average.

3. **Demographic Factors:** All three are Gateway Cities with similar demographics including high percentages of economically disadvantaged students and English Learners. These factors are important but do not fully explain the spending vs. performance gap.
