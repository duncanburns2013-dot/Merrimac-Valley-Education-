# Gateway Cities Educational Crisis: Haverhill, Lawrence & Methuen
## A Comprehensive Analysis of Spending vs. Performance (2019-2025)

---

## Executive Summary

Three neighboring Gateway Cities in the Merrimack Valley—Haverhill, Lawrence, and Methuen—demonstrate a troubling pattern: **significant increases in per-pupil spending paired with declining student achievement**. Despite investing millions more in education, all three districts have seen dramatic drops in student proficiency across core subjects.

### The Common Pattern
- **All three cities increased spending by 22-33%** over six years
- **All three cities saw ELA proficiency decline by 6-10 points**
- **All three cities saw Math proficiency decline by 6-8 points**
- **All three cities perform significantly below the Massachusetts state average**

## District-by-District Analysis

### HAVERHILL PUBLIC SCHOOLS

**Spending:**
- 2019: $16,000 per pupil
- 2025: $21,200 per pupil
- **Increase: $5,200 (+32.5%)**

**Performance (Grades 3-8):**
- **ELA:** 38% → 28% proficient (‒10 points)
- **Math:** 37% → 29% proficient (‒8 points)

- Science: 13 points below (29% vs. 42%)

**Key Findings:**
- More than 70% of Haverhill students are NOT proficient in core subjects
- Despite spending $5,200 more per student, proficiency dropped across all subjects
- Performance gap vs. state average is widening, not shrinking

### LAWRENCE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

**Spending:**
- 2019: $18,000 per pupil
- 2025: $22,000 per pupil
- **Increase: $4,000 (+22.2%)**
- **Note:** Highest per-pupil spending of the three districts

**Performance (Grades 3-8):**
- **ELA:** 25% → 19% proficient (‒6 points)
- **Math:** 24% → 18% proficient (‒6 points)

**2025 Gap vs. State Average:**
- ELA: 23 points below (19% vs. 42%)
- Math: 23 points below (18% vs. 41%)

**Key Findings:**
- Lawrence has been under state receivership since 2011
- Despite being the highest-spending district, it has the worst outcomes
- Only 1 in 5 students are proficient in ELA or Math
- **More than 80% of Lawrence students are NOT proficient**

### METHUEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

**Spending:**
- 2019: $15,500 per pupil
- 2025: $19,500 per pupil
- **Increase: $4,000 (+25.8%)**

**Performance (Grades 3-8):**
- **ELA:** 36% → 26% proficient (‒10 points)
- **Math:** 35% → 27% proficient (‒8 points)

**2025 Gap vs. State Average:**
- ELA: 16 points below (26% vs. 42%)
- Math: 14 points below (27% vs. 41%)

**Key Findings:**
- Methuen spends the least of the three but has middle-tier performance
- Still, more than 70% of students are NOT proficient
- Named among 15 districts with highest MCAS failure rates

## Comparative Analysis

### Spending Efficiency
**2025 Spending Per Proficient Student (ELA):**
- Haverhill: $75,714 per proficient student
- Lawrence: $115,789 per proficient student (highest cost)
- Methuen: $75,000 per proficient student

**Interpretation:** Lawrence spends 22% more per pupil than Methuen but produces proficiency at a 54% higher cost per successful student.

### The Spending Paradox
All three districts follow the same troubling pattern:

1. **More Money:** Spending increased 22-33%
2. **Worse Results:** Proficiency declined 6-10 points
3. **Growing Gaps:** Falling further behind state average
4. **No Correlation:** Higher spending does NOT predict better outcomes

**Lawrence** spends the most ($22,000) but has the worst results (19% ELA proficient).
**Methuen** spends the least ($19,500) but performs better than Lawrence (26% ELA proficient).

### Historical Context
The COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021) clearly disrupted learning. However:
- State-wide proficiency has partially recovered from 2021 lows
- These three districts have shown minimal recovery
- The gap between these districts and state average is widening
- Additional spending has not accelerated recovery

## What This Means for Taxpayers

### The Investment
Over six years, these three districts increased annual per-pupil spending by a combined:
- **Haverhill:** $5,200 per student
- **Lawrence:** $4,000 per student
- **Methuen:** $4,000 per student

With approximate enrollments:
- Haverhill (8,000 students): **+$41.6 million annually**
- Lawrence (13,300 students): **+$53.2 million annually**
- Methuen (6,600 students): **+$26.4 million annually**

**Combined: Over $121 million in additional annual spending**

### The Return
- ELA proficiency declined in all three districts
- Math proficiency declined in all three districts
- Science proficiency declined
- All three districts remain far below state average
- No district shows meaningful recovery from pandemic losses

## Critical Questions

1. **Where is the money going?**
   - Why has a 22-33% increase in spending not improved outcomes?
   - What specific programs or initiatives received the additional funds?
   - Are administrative costs growing faster than classroom investments?

2. **Why are outcomes declining?**
   - What factors beyond funding affect student achievement?
   - Are instructional methods effective?
   - How does chronic absenteeism affect these numbers?

3. **Is spending the right solution?**
   - Lawrence spends the most but has the worst outcomes
   - This suggests spending alone is not the answer
   - What other interventions are needed?

4. **What is the accountability mechanism?**
   - Who is responsible for these outcomes?
   - What consequences exist for persistent underperformance?
   - How are taxpayer funds being stewarded?

## Regional Context

These three neighboring Gateway Cities share similar demographics and challenges:
- Working-class communities
- Significant English Learner populations
- High percentages of economically disadvantaged students
- Legacy manufacturing economies transitioning to service sectors

Yet all three demonstrate the same pattern: **rising costs, falling performance**.

This is not about one superintendent, one school committee, or one political party. This is a **systemic regional crisis** requiring urgent attention and bold solutions.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Demand Transparency**
   - Require detailed breakdowns of where additional spending is allocated
   - Track spending per student by school, not just district averages
   - Make budget documents accessible and understandable to voters

2. **Focus on Outcomes, Not Inputs**
   - Stop measuring success by dollars spent
   - Start measuring success by student proficiency rates
   - Tie funding increases to performance improvement benchmarks

3. **Learn from High-Performers**
   - Identify Massachusetts districts with similar demographics but better outcomes
   - Study what they do differently
   - Implement proven practices, not trendy initiatives

4. **Address Root Causes**
   - Chronic absenteeism
   - English Learner support
   - Early childhood literacy
   - Family engagement

5. **Accountability**
   - School committees should answer to voters about these trends
   - Superintendents should present improvement plans with measurable goals
   - State oversight should be meaningful, not bureaucratic

## Conclusion

The data tells a clear and troubling story: **More money is not producing better results in Haverhill, Lawrence, or Methuen.**

Taxpayers have invested millions more in their schools. Students and families deserve to see that investment translate into improved educational outcomes. Instead, they see declining proficiency rates and widening achievement gaps.

This is not sustainable. These communities cannot continue to spend more while achieving less.

**The question is no longer "Are we spending enough?" The question is "What are we getting for what we're spending?"**

And right now, the answer in these three Gateway Cities is deeply unsatisfactory.
